# Ray Tracing

I've recently been into computer graphics. I saw [this project](https://github.com/ebkalderon/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend/tree/master) by [ebkalderon](https://github.com/ebkalderon), so I decided to take a shot at [ray tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I'm most likely not going to finish this in one weekend, but it's whatever (a learning experience).

Update: A weekend has just passed.
